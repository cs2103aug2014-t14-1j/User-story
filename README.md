Jim’s user story

Problem outline: We are bombarded with ‘things to do’ continuously. Some things need to be done during specific times (e.g., attend meeting), some have deadlines (e.g., submit report), and others are simply ‘to be done someday’ (e.g., read ‘Lord of the Rings’).  The pile of todo items accumulates and weighs heavily on our mind at times. Sometimes things go out of control and we forget to do certain things on time.
Solution outline: The software should help user to put these todo items into a systematic process that tracks them and helps the user to decide what to do and when to do things so that the user doesn’t have to remembering the todo items. Our target user does all this by issuing commands via the keyboard.
Target audience: There are many similar software around (todo lists software, calendar software, GTD software). Because it is a crowded product space, our strategy is to become a niche player by targeting a specific user group. Our target users are people Jim whose workflow is described below.

Jim’s user story

Most of Jim’s todo items arrive as emails. This is how Jim processes his emails.
1. Decides what the follow up action required by that email.
2a. If it can be done immediately, he does it right away (e.g., just reply to the email) and ‘archive’ the email (i.e. move it out of inbox).
2b. If it cannot be done immediately, he schedules the follow up action in his calendar and archives the email. If he cannot decide a good time to do the action, he simply schedules it in a relatively free area in his calendar.
3. When Jim is free to do some work, he looks at his calendar and picks up something that he can do at that time. Once the task is done, he marks it as ‘done’. If there is a further follow up action required, he schedules it in the calendar.
4. Jim periodically reviews the calendar to pick items that could not be completed and need to be rescheduled or discarded as ‘cannot do’.
5. Todo items not arising from email are dealt similarly by entering them in the calendar.
